# -Downsampling-and-Upsampling
In this project, I worked on exploring basic image processing techniques mainly focusing on  image resolution changes and gray level reduction. The main goal was to manually implement  these techniques using loops and conditional statements by avoiding built-in MATLAB functions,  to understand how these processes work step by step.
